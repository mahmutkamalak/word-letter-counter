# word-letter-counter
##OBJECTIVE
In this python programming project, I applied to count the total words and characters in a string. The program will take the string as input from the user, count the words and characters and then it will print out the results on the GUI.

##What is Tkinter ?
The tkinter package (“Tk interface”) is the standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit. Both Tk and tkinter are available on most Unix platforms, as well as on Windows systems. (Tk itself is not part of Python; it is maintained at ActiveState.)
Tkinter is lightweight and relatively painless to use compared to other frameworks. This makes it a compelling choice for building GUI applications in Python, especially for applications where a modern sheen is unnecessary, and the top priority is to build something that’s functional and cross-platform quickly.
